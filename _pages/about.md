I'm a first year Computer Science PhD Student at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) working on bias in large language models (LLMs). Under the supervision of [Professor Gianluca Demartini](https://www.gianlucademartini.net/) and [Dr. Kevin Roitero](https://kevinroitero.com/), my current focus revolves around political bias in LLMs, exploring how persona-based prompting can manipulate model outputs and developing bias mitigation strategies to enhance LLMs fairness.

My recent work include:
- Developing a framework for reducing political bias in LLMs using DPO (<u>ongoing</u>).
- Developing a framework for measuring LLMs perspective alignment effectiveness across downstream applications (<u>ongoing</u>).
- Influencing political ideology in LLMs using synthetic personas ([The Web Conference 2025](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3701716.3715578)).
- Examining how data quality impacts LLMs alignment thorugh DPO ([SIGIR-AP 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3673791.3698411)).

I currently also serve as a tutor for [INFS4203](https://programs-courses.uq.edu.au/course.html?course_code=INFS4203) (Data Mining) and [INFS7410](https://programs-courses.uq.edu.au/course.html?course_code=INFS7410) (Information Retrieval and Web Search).
